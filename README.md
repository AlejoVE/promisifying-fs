## Promisifying `fs`

Each exercise file contains fully working code.  You need to refactor each one twice using promisified `fs` functions:

* once as standard promises
* once using async/await

## Getting Started

* Clone the repo
* Get coding! (there are no dependencies)

## Learning Objectives

* Using [util.promisify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch)
* Using `promisify`ed `fs`
* Refactoring from callbacks to promises
* Refactoring from callbacks to async/await
* Refactoring synchronous to asynchronous
